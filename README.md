# Overview
For this program I attemptee to learn about how games are made, specifically in the Arcade library in Python.

My game is a rudimentary platformer. You play the game with the arrow keys, moving left and right and jumping.

My purpose for writing this software was to learn about the capabilities of Arcade and more about game development.
I created the images for the ground and crates myself and created the level the player spawns in on.

# Development Environment
I used VS Code, Tiled, and Gimp to develop this software.

I used Python and its Arcade library to make this game.

# Future Work
* Create a background for the level
* Make it so the player is able to push the crates
* Implement coins the player can collect for points
